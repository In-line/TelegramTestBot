# TelegramTestBot
This was one of my learning projects, dating back to 2016. It's ChatRoulette like Telegram Bot written in C++11. 
I never hosted it, but it should be fairy stable. 

I missed some coding style, but it's just because of inconsistent settings of tabs and spaces in my IDE. 
Anyway, feel free to use this. 

It was my first experience with PostgreSQL, I guess now there are more idiomatic ways to handle SQL queries.

I will not give much support, because it is old learning project (never intended for real use), but you can ask questions.
